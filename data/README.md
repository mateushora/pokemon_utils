## Notes
- Ensure these files are kept up-to-date for accurate results.
- Cached files (i.e., `pokemon_types_cache.json`) can be deleted to force the application to fetch fresh data from the Pok√©API.
- Manually updated files (e.g., `pokemon_all_pokemons_owned.json`) should reflect your current Pok√©mon collection and moves.
