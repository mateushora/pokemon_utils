## üì¶ Modules

### 1. **`pokemon.py`**
The main entry point of the application. This module provides different modes of operation:
- **`quiz`**: Conducts an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Pok√©mon type effectiveness.
- **`types`**: Fetches and displays the types of specified Pok√©mon.
- **`current`**: Analyzes your current Pok√©mon team against specified enemy Pok√©mon and provides recommendations based on move effectiveness and type resistance.
- **`all`**: Similar to `current`, but analyzes all owned Pok√©mon instead of just the current team.
- **`ability`**: Fetches and displays information about specified Pok√©mon abilities.

### 2. **`info.py`**
Handles the core logic for analyzing Pok√©mon battles:
- **`find_best_pokemon`**: Determines the best Pok√©mon to use against specified enemies based on move effectiveness and type resistance.
- **`get_best_moves`**: Calculates the best moves for a Pok√©mon against an enemy, considering move power, accuracy, and type effectiveness.

### 3. **`api.py`**
Handles fetching Pok√©mon data from the Pok√©API:
- **`get_pokemon_types`**: Fetches the types of specified Pok√©mon. If the data is already cached locally, it uses the cache instead of querying the API.
- **`get_ability_type`**: Fetches the type or effect of a specified Pok√©mon ability from a local cache.

> **Note**: The API will only consult the internet once for each Pok√©mon. After storing the information in the local cache, it will always use the cached data.

### 4. **`configs.py`**
Loads and manages configuration data for the application:
- **`POKEMON_TYPE_CHART`**: A dictionary representing type effectiveness (e.g., which types are strong, weak, or immune to others).
- **`ALL_POKEMONS_OWNED`**: A dictionary containing all owned Pok√©mon and their moves.
- **`MOVE_TYPES`**: A dictionary mapping moves to their types, power, and accuracy.
- **`CURRENT_POKEMON_TEAM`**: A list of Pok√©mon names representing the current team.

### 5. **`learn.py`**
Provides an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Pok√©mon type effectiveness:
- Prompts the user to guess which types are strong, weak, immune, or not very effective against a randomly selected type.
- Evaluates the user's answers and provides feedback on correct, incorrect, and missed answers.

## üìÇ JSON Files

All JSON files are located in the `data` folder.

### 1. **`data/pokemon_types_cache.json`**
- **Purpose**: Stores the types of Pok√©mon fetched from the Pok√©API.
- **When to Change**: 
  - If new Pok√©mon are added to the game or if you want to update the types of existing Pok√©mon.
  - If the cache becomes outdated or corrupted, you can delete it to force the application to fetch fresh data from the API.

### 2. **`data/pokemon_all_pokemons_owned.json`**
- **Purpose**: Stores all owned Pok√©mon and their moves.
- **When to Change**:
  - When you acquire new Pok√©mon or update the moves of existing Pok√©mon.
  - This file should be manually updated to reflect your current collection.

### 3. **`data/pokemon_ability_types_cache.json`**
- **Purpose**: Stores information about Pok√©mon abilities, including their type, power, and accuracy.
- **When to Change**:
  - If new abilities are introduced or if you want to update the data for existing abilities.
  - This file is used as a local cache and should be updated manually if needed.

### 4. **`data/pokemon_type_chart.json`**
- **Purpose**: Represents the type effectiveness chart, detailing which types are strong, weak, or immune to others.
- **When to Change**:
  - If the type effectiveness rules are updated (e.g., in a new game generation).
  - This file should only be modified if there are changes to the official type effectiveness chart.
